Author analyzed oceanic precipitation at zonal scales for products: GPCP (global precipitation climatology project), merged CloudSat CPR
 and TRMM-PR, CMAP (Climate predicting center Merged Analysis of Precipitation) at 80N to 80S. The results shown that the new merged 
 TRMM/CloudSat estimates rain rate is 2.94 mm/day 9% higher than CMAP, 4% higher than GPCP,

Author summarized following general partterns: (a) increased precipitation in high latitudes (NH); (b) reductions in precipitation in China, Australia and the Small Island Staates in the Pacific; (c) equatorial regions becone more variable, i.e. increased variance.

Annual zonally averaged precipitation increased by between 7% and 12% for the zones 30N to 85N and by about 2%between 0S and 55S.
