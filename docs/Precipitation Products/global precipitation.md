Author analyzed oceanic precipitation at zonal scales for products: GPCP (global precipitation climatology project), merged CloudSat CPR
 and TRMM-PR, CMAP (Climate predicting center Merged Analysis of Precipitation) at 80N to 80S. The results shown that the new merged 
 TRMM/CloudSat estimates rain rate is 2.94 mm/day 9% higher than CMAP, 4% higher than GPCP,
