The author compared rain gauge raw data and radar-gauge collicated QPE product by feeding into hydrologic simulations, and results suggest the improvement introduced by using radar QPE data is in fact more obvious to groundwater than to surface water at daily scale.The radar QPE based model demonstrates the added value of the extra information from radar when rain gauge density decreases; however it is not able to sustain the level of model performance preceding the reduction in number of rain gauges.

It is shown that both gauges and radar seriously underestimated event rainfall, and the Z-R relation should be ajusted during extreme events to get better estimation.
