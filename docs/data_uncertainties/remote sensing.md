Author compared satellite data from PERSIANN-CCS, and NCEP stage IV radar data as reference from temperal, and spatial scale. From the analysis, satellite errors (RMSE) is mitigated as aggreated space and time, but the percentage of error (normalized) indicated that satellite tends to have larger relative error in lower range of rainfall intensity. What's more, author evaluated the error propogation by a hydrologic simulation, and offered an uncertainty estimation.
