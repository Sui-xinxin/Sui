Author described the severity of Harvey, highest record of rainfall accumulated in this region ever, contributing to more than $125 billion Texas infrastructure loss and multiple faltalities. The author compared GPM-IMERG satellite data and NCEP stage IV QPE (4km) ground radar data as reference. The results indicated that IMERG is capable of detecting spatial variability of the storm and 62% accuracy in reconstructing rainfall field. But under-represented in coastal areas and over-representated in high-intensity regions. The IMERG data degrades along the core.

Author showed an improvement if IMERG data compared to TMPA data in detecting extreme rainfall events in India. Even though the TMPA data showed a larger probability of detection of heavy rainfall events most parts of the country, it showed a large false alarm ratio and a relatively small critical success index.

Author here proposed a way to quantify the accuracy of IMERG data in extreme events for varying temporal aggregations. The results showed that, when aggregation time exceeds 12 hours, then IMERG can guarantee a good result.
