__Omranian, E., et al. (2018). "How Well Can Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Capture Hurricanes? Case Study: Hurricane Harvey." Remote Sensing 10(7).__
	
Author described the severity of Harvey, highest record of rainfall accumulated in this region ever, contributing to more than $125 billion Texas infrastructure loss and multiple faltalities. The author compared GPM-IMERG satellite data and NCEP stage IV QPE (4km) ground radar data as reference. The results indicated that IMERG is capable of detecting spatial variability of the storm and 62% accuracy in reconstructing rainfall field. But under-represented in coastal areas and over-representated in high-intensity regions. The IMERG data degrades along the core.
